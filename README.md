In this repo I put together a curriculum for some one to go from zero background to employable data scientist


# Lower Tier
The very basics of linear algebra forms the basis of most complex machine learning algorithms. So its important to know the basics right.
So start with Khan Academy.

JavaScript

Shell Scripting/UNIX

git/SCRUM/CI/CD/TDD

# Middle Tier
Here we study bioinformatics platforms, software and tools and pipelines related to current omics

1. CDL/WDL
